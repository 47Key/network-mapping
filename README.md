# Keymap - Desktop & Web Application for Network Mapping

## Still In Progress

This is a GUI tool that allows you to scan your network and process multiple types of PCAP files to display. It will display the data extracted from PCAP files to map every device on your network and what they are doing on the network.

When this is complete, it will allow you to find unusual network traffic, requests, devices, etc..

This will be a helpful tool for both red & blue cybersecurity teams.
